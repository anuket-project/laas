The dashboard is deployed using docker-compose.
Application / database files are saved in /var/lib/pharos_dashboard/.

Deployment:

- clone the repository
- complete the config.env.sample file and save it as config.env
- install docker, docker-compose and bower
- run 'bower install' in ./src/static/ to fetch javascript dependencies
- run 'make build' to build the containers
- run 'make data'
- run 'make up' to run the dashboard

Updating:

- make stop
- git pull
- run 'bower install' if javascript dependencies changed

If there is migrations that need user input (like renaming a field), they need to be run manually!
