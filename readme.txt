The dashboard is deployed using docker-compose.

Application / database files are saved in the 'laas-data' container
which needs to be pre-built before bringing up the dashboard.

Deployment:

- clone the repository
- complete the config.env.sample file and save it as config.env
- install docker, docker-compose
- run 'make data'
- run 'make up' to run the dashboard (or 'make dev-up' for development)
- get the rsa.pem and rsa.pub keys from your jira admin and place them in src/account

Production will be running on port 80 by default.
Development will be running on port 8000 by default.

Updating:

- run 'docker-compose pull'
- run 'docker-compose up -d'
- make stop
- git pull
- make build
- make start

If there is migrations that need user input (like renaming a field), they need to be run manually!

Logs / Shell access:

- there is some shortcuts in the makefile

Development:

- Install dependencies listed in 'Deployment'
- run 'make build'
- run 'make dev-up'
